# IE306 - Systems Simulation

The course is organized to introduce basic concepts of discrete-event simulation (DES) modeling and analysis. After providing an understanding about the two basic approaches to DES (Event-scheduling versus Process-interaction approach), the focus will be set on input data analysis, and random number and variate generation (inverse transformation and other selected techniques). During model construction stage, the students will be instructed about widely used computer simulation languages, and will have hands-on experience with [ARENA](https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-us/products/software/arena-simulation.html) and [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The final section of the course deals with model validation and output analysis.
