# CmpE478 - Parallel Processing

Parallel machine and performance models: PRAM, speedup, work efficiency, scalability, Brent's theorem. Parallel programming with message passing and multi-threading libraries. Parallel algorithms: Prefix computation, pointer jumping, list ranking, Euler tours on trees, sorting. Parallel architectures: Multiprocessors, multicomputers and Flynn's taxonomy, SIMD, MIMD, SPMD, interconnection topologies. Load balancing and graph partitioning methods.

Projects given in this course could be implemented in groups of at most two students. My partner was [Elif Bayraktar](https://github.com/BElifb).
