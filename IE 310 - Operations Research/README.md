# IE310 - Operations Research

This course is designed to be an introduction to the most widely used deterministic operations research
methodologies. The course will start by introducing mathematical modeling and optimization concepts
and basic linear programming then move into duality theory. Emphasis will also be given to integer
programming models and the branch and bound technique. Basic network models and their links with
integer programming will be presented. Available software for solving these optimization problems will
be discussed. The last part of the course consists in introducing non-linear optimization.
