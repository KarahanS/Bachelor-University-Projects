## Description
* Open the project folder in terminal. 
* Please put the `data.txt` file in the same directory as the `.py` file.
   ```bash
  Assignment2
   ├── pagerank.py
   ├── data.txt
   └── README.md
   ```
* You do not have to install any additional libraries since all the libraries used are built-in Python libraries. If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). I used Python `3.9.13`.
* Run the following command in terminal to execute the program.
    ```bash
    python pagerank.py
    ```
